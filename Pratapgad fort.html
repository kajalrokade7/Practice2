     	Pratapgad is a mountain fort located in Satara district, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. The fort is situated 24 kilometres from the Mahabaleshwar hill station. The fort is now a popular tourist destination.

        The fort's historical significance is due to the Battle of Pratapgad, which took place here on 10 November 1659, between Shivaji I and Bijapur Sultanate general Afzal Khan.
